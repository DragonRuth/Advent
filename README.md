# Advent of code 2022

Ruby

This is for fun puzzle solutions for advent of code 2022.  
The goal is to try and write solutions in as little code lines as possible, as much in the functional style as possible, just to add a little extra spice into the mix 

Solutions are mostly "emergent" and not necesseraly optimized :)

God Jul!
